### 1. Introduction
In this project, I applied Linear Regression of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm on a dataset to understand a linear relationship between features of the dataset.

### 2. Python Libraries
I have Anaconda Python distribution installed on my system. It comes with most of the standard Python libraries I need for this project. The basic Python libraries used in this project are :
- **Numpy** → For numerical operations  
- **Pandas** → For data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** → For plotting and visualizations  
- **Seaborn** → For advanced statistical graphics
- **Sci-kit Learn** → For applying model


### 3. Problem Statement
The aim of these project is to understand the linear relationship between advertising expenditure on TV and Sales of the TV. I also built a model based on linear regression for predicting new values.
The objective of this project was to analyze the impact of television advertising expenditure on product sales.

### 4. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a Supervised Learning Algorithm used to describe the linear relationship between features of the dataset. It basically maps data/features onto a line and tries to predict unseen values based on the training.


    y = ax + b

This is the simple equation used in the Linear Regression, where a is the slope of a line and b represents the intercept.


### 5. About the Dataset
- The dataset contains only 2 columns i.e. TV_advertising expenditure and sales
- Both are numerical variables
- Given in the Repo

### 6. Insights & Findings
- There is a positive linear relationship between TV advertising expenditure and sales — as TV ad spend increases, sales also increase.
- The scatter plot with regression line shows the data points closely aligned, indicating a strong relationship.

### 7. Conclusion
The analysis concludes that TV advertising spend has a significant and positive impact on sales. The linear regression model is effective in predicting sales based on TV advertising expenditure, with a high explanatory power (R² score). This means businesses can use the model to estimate how changes in TV advertising budgets will likely affect sales, enabling better marketing strategy and budget allocation.
